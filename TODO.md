## The Bear Game

[x] GUI / Storytelling / Tutorial / Tasks things
[x] Stamina/hunger/health/protection like values?*
[x] Wolves? To keep it interesting and "survive"
[ ] Wolves steal when you're carrying, but that doesn't work properly.
[x] Weather (influence above values, changes spawn rates)
<!-- [ ] Hidey holes for increased protection etc?* -->
<!-- [ ] Fish & Water, just to mix it up. -->
[x] Based on story; we need mom
<!-- [ ] Based on story, we need to grow up as bear -->
[x] Based on the story, we need an endgame.
[x] Art for the endings (win/lose), calc score perhaps?

--- EXTRA'S

Add a margin to the collission detection radius, make things smaller or bigger.

--- KNOWN BUGS

- [X] Hard reloading makes the sprites not work properly, it seems?  Sort of fixed, but needs to be fixed in the engine.
