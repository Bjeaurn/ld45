[ ] Weather (influence above values, changes spawn rates)
[ ] Hidey holes for increased protection etc?*
[ ] Wolves? To keep it interesting and "survive"
[ ] Fish & Water, just to mix it up.
[ ] Based on story; we need mom
[ ] Based on story, we need to grow up as bear

--- EXTRA'S

Add a margin to the collission detection radius, make things smaller or bigger.

--- KNOWN BUGS

- [X] Hard reloading makes the sprites not work properly, it seems?  Sort of fixed, but needs to be fixed in the engine.
