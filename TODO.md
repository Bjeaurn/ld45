[ ] Stamina/hunger/health/protection like values?
[ ] Weather (influence above values, changes spawn rates)
[ ] Hidey holes for increased protection etc?
[ ] GUI / Storytelling / Tutorial / Tasks things

--- EXTRA'S

Add a margin to the collission detection radius, make things smaller or bigger.

--- KNOWN BUGS

- [X] Hard reloading makes the sprites not work properly, it seems?  Sort of fixed, but needs to be fixed in the engine.
