## The Bear Game
[x] Do collission detection (with any form of elements)
[x] Handle "attacking" entities, including killing entities.

[x] Basic AI for our "bunny", think hopping around, stopping for grass, getting a little scared etc.

--- Basic game mechanics done ---

[ ] Trees! Lots and lots of trees!



--- EXTRA'S

Add a margin to the collission detection radius, make things smaller or bigger.

--- KNOWN BUGS

Hard reloading makes the sprites not work properly, it seems?
